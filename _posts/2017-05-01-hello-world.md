# Hello, world!


Someone whose opinion I respect told me to start a blog, so here I am. I thought I would blog about programming-related adventures and misadventures, but I don't know where to start. So let's do a personal blog for this first, introductory post.

For the past month, life has been happening. Hard.

I sat down last night and took a moment to just breathe. It occurred to me that Eliot was onto something when he wrote, "April is the cruellest month." In the past month, I:

1. Quit my stable, middle-class position as a teacher
2. Started a [coding bootcamp](http://www.digitalcrafts.com)
3. Got in a car wreck
4. Chopped off all my hair
5. And subsequently got told to "Eat sh*t, gay boy" by a passing stranger
6. Put our cat through a $3000 emergency surgery
7. Had to put down said cat when the surgery unfortunately didn't work
8. Organized a Mini-Hackathon for the Houston freeCodeCamp group

And so on. Oh, and did I mention I'm in the process of moving, too?

As I write this, April is (thankfully) coming to a close, and hopefully will go down in the books as the craziest month of my life.

Also as I write this, I'm in awe at how satisfied and energized I am, in spite of it all. Though there were aspects of teaching that I truly loved, I am so, so glad I summoned the courage to quit. Until now, I've never felt so confident that my life was moving in the right direction, and that I am truly spending the bulk of the day pursuing my passion.

Sitting in front of a computer all day is certainly not everyone's idea of fun, but for me, there is absolutely nothing I'd rather be doing, and I can't wait to see how things unfold as I attempt to shape this passion of mine into some sort of career.

Well. I guess that's it.

Until next time.
